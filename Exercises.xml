                     This is a balanced hand.  16 points and no distribution points.  Therefore, bid 1 NT.
  
 
                  </explanationpart1>
 <explanationpart2>
A balanced hand WILL contain cards in all four suits (so your hand will contain cards in each of the suits – spaces, hearts, diamonds AND clubs).
 
A balanced hand will NOT contain a void (no cards in a suit).
 
A balanced hand will NOT contain a singleton -(just one card in a suit).
 
A balanced hand CAN contain only ONE doubleton.
  
A balanced hand CAN contain a 5 card suit.
                 </explanationpart2>
<explanationpart3>
 
Remember: The patterns for a balanced hand are:  4-3-3-3, 4-5-3-2, 5-3-3-2 and  1 NT is bid with 15-17 points and a balanced hand.

                     This is a balanced hand.  There are 12 hcp and 1 distribution point (for the 5 card run in Spades).    Therefore, bid 1 Spade.
                     
                     Even though this is a balanced hand, there are not 15-17 points so you cannot bid 1 NT, but there are just enough (13) points to open.

                     This is a balanced hand.  There are 16 high card points and 1 distribution points for a total of 17 points.
                                        
                      You may be tempted to bid Spades, but that would imply you have 13-21 points with an unbalanced hand.  You have a balanced hand with 17 points, so you 
need to communicate that to your partner.

                     This is an unbalanced hand.  There are 14 hcp and 2 distribution points (1 each for the two 5 card runs in Spades and Hearts).

                 <explanationpart3>
                     Though there are 15-17 points, you cannot bid 1 NT because this hand is unbalanced.

                     With no five-card suit, open a minor suit.  With a choice of three-card minor suits, open the lower-ranking.  Bid 1 Club.

                 <explanationpart3>
                       To remember what to bid in minor suits with 4 of each or 3 of each, use this trick:  Diamonds have 4 sides, Clubs have 3 parts.  So if you have 4 of both, bid Diamonds.  If you have 3 of both, bid Clubs.
                       If you have 4 of one and 3 of the other, bid the one with 4.

                     This is an unbalanced hand.  There are 11 hcp and 2 distribution points (1 for the 5 card run in Spades, and 1 more for the 5 card run in Clubs).

                     With enough to open the bidding and a hand containing two five-card suits, open the higher suit, 1 Spade.

                     You might think the clubs are stronger, but it is harder to make game in Clubs.  In any case the rule
                     is to open the higher of two suits when they both are the same length if 5 or more.

         <description>
                             When your partner opens the bidding at 1 NT, you as a responder know that the opener has 15,16,17 HCP (the opener does not consider distribution points when opening NT).
               By adding your strength to that of the opener's, you can usually tell whether the partnership has at least 25 combined points, enough for a game contract, or fewer than 15 combined points.
               enough only for a part-score contract.

                     points needed for a game contract.  Responder passes because responder knows the contract should be a part-score.

                     With 9 total points, responder knows the combined strength is either 24,25 or 26.   The responder
                     will need more information from opener before deciding whether the partnership should be in game.

                 <explanationpart2>
                      A bid of 2NT is an invitation to the opener to decide to go to game or not, because the opener knows that the responder
                      would have jumped to 3NT if the minimum of 25 points was guaranteed.   With this invitation, the opener would rebid to 3NT if the opener had 16 or 17 points.
                      2NT also tells the opener the responder has a balanced hand.

                     Remember that the opener of 1 NT shows one of the following hand patterns (4-3-3-3,4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2).  When opener
                     bids 1NT, opener promises at least two cards in each suite (and usually 3 cards).

                 <explanationpart2>
                 Responder has a six-card Spade suite, Opener has at least 2 spades, so responder can be sure there is a Golden Fit
                 with at least 8 Spades and at least 26 points (only 25 is needed for game)
                 </explanationpart2>
                 <explanationpart3>
So responder jumps to game with 4 spades

                     Remember that the opener of 1 NT shows one of the following hand patterns (4-3-3-3,4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2).  When opener
                     bids 1NT, opener promises at least two cards in each suite (and usually 3 cards).

                 <explanationpart2>
                 Responder has a five-card Heart suite, Opener has at least 2 Hearts, so responder cannot be sure there is a Golden Fit
                 as there may be only 7 Heart cards.   Therefore the responder must invite the opener to decide if there is enough.	
                 </explanationpart2>
                 <explanationpart3>
                   There are enough points for a game, but only if there are 8 or more hearts.
                   If the opener only had 2 hearts, the opener would probably respond with 3NT to get into game.

                     With only a four-card suit, it is unlikely there is a Golden Fit  Opener will have 4 or more diamonds less than half the time.

                     With 12 total points, you know you want to play in game because you have at least 26 points between you (the opening bid of 1NT promised 15-17 points).
                     The opener has at least 2 Spades and thus you have at least 8 Spades between you - a Golden Fit.

                   You have 11 total points, enough for game.  With only two cards in each major, there is no possibility
                   of a Golden Fit in a major suit.  Though you could have a Golden Fit in a minor suit (Diamonds), there would be a need for a total
                   point count of 29.   The maximum you have between you is 28 (17 + 11).  A no trump game is the mostly likely winning scenario.

                 Place the final contract in 3 NT.
                                   This is a stopping bid.  The opener will not rebid higher.  Even if they have 17 points and you had 15 points, 32 is not enough for a small slam
                  so there is no point in bidding higher than game.

                 With 13 total points and a five-card major suit, you want to play game at 4 Hearts and should do so
                 if opener has three or more; otherwise you want to end bidding at 3NT.  
                 
                 By bidding 3 Hearts, the opener knows you have 10 or more points and thus should probably be in game, at least 
                 with 3NT (10+15=25 points).  Opener knows you don't have 0-7 points, or you would have bid only 2 Hearts with 
                 five Hearts. Opener knows you don't have 8-9 points because you would have bid 2NT.  Since you didn't jump
                 to 4 Hearts (for game) opener knows you must not have 6 Hearts.

                 Make a forcing bid at 3 Hearts.
               The opener will ether bid 4 Hearts if opener has 3 or more Hearts, or game at 3 NT.

                 With 10 total points and a four-card major suit, you cannot be sure of a Golden Fit in Spades because
                 the opener has only promised 2 Spades.  You don't have the room to explore if opener has 3 Spades, but
                 you do have at least 25 points (15+10) between you ... enough for a game in NT.

                With 10 total points and a four-card major suit, you could use the Stayman convention (2 Clubs)
                 to ask if opener has a four-card major.  However, assuming you don't know about Stayman, bid 3NT.
                   This is a stopping bid.  The opener has not need to bid higher than game.

                 have enough for game (17+7-or-less), so you can't bid more Spades.  Partner has made a sign-off bid

                 Responder has 8 or 9 points.  If you have 15, then 23 is not enough for game, so you would pass.
                 If you have 16 you have 24 which is still not enough for game so you would pass.
                 But you have 17 points, so between you you have 25 or 26 points.  Enough for game in NT.

                 By bidding 3 Hearts the responder is telling you that they have 5 Heart cards and 10-15 points.
                Since you have 3 Hearts, you have a Golden Fit with 8 Hearts and at least 25 points.
